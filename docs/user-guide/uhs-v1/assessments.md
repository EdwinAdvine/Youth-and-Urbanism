## Types of Assessments

There are four types of assessments you may encounter:

| Type | Description | Typical Format |
|---|---|---|
| Quiz | A quick check on what you have learned | Multiple choice questions, often timed |
| Assignment | A task that requires you to apply what you learned | Written responses or file uploads |
| Project | A larger piece of work completed over several days or weeks | Multi-part submission with milestones |
| Exam | A comprehensive test covering a wide range of topics | Multiple question types, timed |

Each course may include one or more of these assessment types. Some are required for course completion, while others are optional practice.

## Taking a Quiz

Quizzes are the most common type of assessment. They test your understanding of recent lessons.

### How to Start a Quiz

1. You will find quizzes in two places:

   - Inside a course, after completing the relevant lesson or module.
2. Click on the quiz to open it.
3. Read the instructions carefully before starting.

### During the Quiz

1. Each question appears one at a time or all at once, depending on how the instructor set it up.
2. For **multiple choice** questions, select the answer you think is correct.
3. If the quiz is **timed**, a countdown timer appears at the top of the screen. Keep an eye on it.
4. You can navigate between questions using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons (if allowed).
5. Questions you have answered are marked with a checkmark.
6. You can change your answer before submitting.

### Submitting a Quiz

1. Once you have answered all questions, click **Submit Quiz**.
2. A confirmation dialog will ask if you are sure. Click **Yes, Submit**.
3. Your score is displayed immediately after submission.

### After the Quiz

## Submitting Assignments

Assignments require you to produce work -- such as writing an essay, solving problems, or analyzing a topic.

### How to Start an Assignment

1. Find the assignment in **Today's Tasks** or inside the relevant course.
2. Click on the assignment to open it.

Depending on the assignment type, you may need to:

- **Type your response** in the text editor provided. You can format your text with headings, bold, italics, and lists.
- **Upload a file** such as a document (PDF, DOC), image (JPG, PNG), or spreadsheet. Click **Upload File** and select the file from your device.
- **Combine both**: Some assignments accept a written response and file attachments.

### Saving Your Work

- Click **Save Draft** to save your progress without submitting. You can come back and continue later.
- Your draft is saved automatically at regular intervals, but it is a good idea to click Save Draft periodically.

### Submitting

2. Confirm your submission.

## Working on Projects

Projects are extended assessments that may take days or weeks to complete. They often involve research, creativity, and multiple stages of work.

### How Projects Work

1. Open the project from your course page or **Today's Tasks**.
2. Read the **project brief** carefully. It explains:
   - What you need to create or investigate.
   - The deliverables (what you need to submit).
   - The timeline and milestones.
   - The grading rubric (how your work will be evaluated).
3. Some projects have **milestones** -- intermediate deadlines for parts of the project. Complete these on time.

### Working on a Project

- Break the project into smaller tasks and work on them over time.
- Save your progress regularly using **Save Draft**.
- If the project has milestones, submit each milestone by its deadline.
- Use The Bird AI for help with research, brainstorming, or understanding concepts.

### Submitting a Project

1. When you have completed all parts of the project, click **Submit Project**.
2. Attach any required files.
3. Write a brief summary of what you did and what you learned (if requested).
4. Confirm your submission.

### Grading

- Projects are typically graded on multiple criteria (e.g., content quality, creativity, effort, presentation).
- The rubric shows how points are distributed across these criteria.
- Your instructor will provide detailed feedback along with your grade.

## Viewing Grades and Feedback

### Where to Find Your Grades

- **Course page**: Each assessment shows your grade next to it.
- **My Grades**: Go to your profile or the grades section in the sidebar to see a summary of all your scores.
- **Dashboard**: Your Today's Tasks section shows recently graded items.

### Understanding Feedback

Instructors may provide feedback in several forms:

- **Written comments**: Notes about what you did well and what to improve.
- **Inline annotations**: Comments on specific parts of your submission.
- **Rubric scores**: Points awarded for each grading criterion.
- **Overall grade**: A score or percentage for the assessment.

Read feedback carefully -- it helps you understand your mistakes and improve for next time.

## Retaking Assessments

Some assessments allow retakes. Here is how it works:

### Quizzes

- If the instructor allows retakes, you will see a **Retake Quiz** button after viewing your results.
- The number of allowed retakes may be limited (e.g., up to 3 attempts).
- Your highest score is usually the one that counts, though this depends on the instructor's settings.

### Assignments

- Assignments generally do not allow retakes unless the instructor specifically enables resubmission.
- If resubmission is allowed, you will see an **Edit and Resubmit** option.

### Exams

- Exams typically cannot be retaken. You get one attempt.
- If there are exceptional circumstances, contact your instructor to discuss options.

## Understanding Scoring

### Percentage Scores

Most assessments are scored as a percentage:

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 90% - 100% | Excellent -- you have a strong understanding |
| 70% - 89% | Good -- you understand most of the material |
| 50% - 69% | Fair -- you have some understanding but need to review |
| Below 50% | Needs improvement -- revisit the lessons and try again |

### Passing Scores

- Each assessment has a **passing score** set by the instructor (commonly 50% or 70%).
- You must pass required assessments to complete the course and earn a certificate.

### How Scores Affect Your Progress

- Quiz and exam scores contribute to your overall course grade.
- Assignment and project grades may carry more weight than quizzes.
- Your course completion requires both finishing all lessons and passing all required assessments.
