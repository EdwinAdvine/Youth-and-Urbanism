## Sponsoring Children's Education

### How Sponsorship Works

1. You allocate a budget for student sponsorships.
2. Students are matched to your sponsorship based on criteria you define (grade level, location, financial need, subject area).
3. Sponsored students gain access to courses, AI tutoring, and other platform features at no cost to their families.
4. You receive regular reports on how your sponsored students are doing.

### Setting Up a Sponsorship

2. Click **Create New Sponsorship**.

   - **Number of students**: How many students you want to sponsor.
   - **Grade levels**: Which grades to focus on (or all grades).
   - **Subjects or courses**: Specific courses or learning areas, or leave open for general access.
   - **Duration**: How long the sponsorship lasts (monthly, termly, annually).
   - **Budget**: Total amount allocated.
4. Choose a matching method:
   - **Automatic matching**: The platform selects eligible students based on your criteria.
   - **Manual selection**: You choose specific students from a list of eligible candidates.
   - **School-based**: Sponsor students from a specific school or community.
5. Review and confirm the sponsorship.
6. Make the initial payment using M-Pesa, PayPal, or bank transfer.
