# Parent Guide

Welcome to the Urban Home School Parent Guide. As a parent, you play a central role in your child's education. This guide shows you how to monitor progress, manage your children's accounts, understand AI insights, handle payments, and communicate with instructors.

## Dashboard Overview

Your Parent Dashboard is designed to give you a clear picture of how your children are doing at a glance.

### Children's Highlights

At the top of your dashboard, you will see a card for each of your children showing:

- **Recent activity**: The last lesson, quiz, or assignment they completed.
- **Current streak**: How many consecutive days they have been learning.
- **Active courses**: Which courses they are enrolled in.
- **Overall progress**: A percentage showing their average course completion.

Click on any child's card to see their detailed profile and learning history.

### Urgent Items

This section flags things that need your attention:

- Overdue assignments or quizzes.
- Declining quiz scores in a subject.
- Courses that have not been opened in a while.
- Upcoming live sessions or deadlines.

### Mood Snapshot

The Bird AI provides a mood and engagement snapshot for each child based on their learning patterns. This might include observations like:

- "Amara has been very engaged in Science this week."
- "Brian's activity dropped in Mathematics -- he might need extra support."
- "Joy completed all her tasks on time for the third week in a row."

These are AI-generated observations meant to help you understand your child's learning habits, not medical or psychological assessments.

## Understanding AI Insights About Your Child

The Bird AI continuously observes how your child learns and provides insights to help you support them.

### What the AI Tracks

- **Learning pace**: Is your child progressing steadily, or are they stuck on certain topics?
- **Strengths**: Subjects and topics where your child excels.
- **Areas for improvement**: Topics that need more practice.
- **Engagement patterns**: When your child is most active and focused.
- **Question patterns**: What kinds of questions your child asks The Bird.

### How to Use These Insights

- If the AI flags a weak area, consider enrolling your child in a focused course on that topic.
- If your child is excelling, let them explore more advanced content.
- Use engagement data to set study schedules at times when your child is naturally more focused.
- Discuss the insights with your child's instructor for additional support.

### Important Notes About AI Insights

- These insights are generated by AI and are meant to be helpful guides, not definitive assessments.
- They are based on your child's interactions with the platform and should be considered alongside your own observations.
- If you have concerns about your child's learning, speak with a qualified educator or specialist.

## CBC Competency Tracking

Urban Home School courses are aligned with Kenya's Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). This means you can track your child's progress against national standards.

### What You Will See

- **Learning areas**: Each course maps to a CBC learning area (Mathematics, Sciences, Languages, Social Studies, Creative Arts, and more).
- **Competencies**: Specific skills and knowledge your child is expected to master at their grade level.
- **Progress indicators**: Shows whether your child is approaching, meeting, or exceeding each competency.

### Understanding the Competency Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Beginning | Your child is starting to develop this skill. |
| Approaching | Your child is making progress but has not fully mastered it. |
| Meeting | Your child has met the expected level for their grade. |
| Exceeding | Your child is performing above their grade level. |

You can view competency tracking under **My Children > [Child Name] > CBC Progress**.
