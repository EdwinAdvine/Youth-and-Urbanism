## What Are Certificates?

Certificates are official digital credentials awarded to students who successfully complete courses on the Urban Home School platform. Each certificate serves as a verifiable record of your academic achievement and can be shared with schools, employers, or on professional profiles.

Certificates are generated automatically by the platform and include security features like unique IDs and QR codes to prevent forgery.

## Earning a Certificate

To earn a certificate for a course, you must meet the following requirements:

### Completion Requirements

1. **Complete all lessons**: Every lesson in the course must be marked as complete. You can check your progress on the course detail page.
2. **Pass the final assessment**: Most courses require passing a final quiz, exam, or project with a minimum score. The required passing score is set by the instructor and is typically 60% or higher.
3. **Meet minimum attendance** (for courses with live sessions): If the course includes live teaching sessions, you may need to attend a minimum percentage of those sessions.

### How Certificates Are Issued

Once you meet all the requirements, the certificate is generated automatically. You will receive a notification informing you that your certificate is ready. There is no need to request it manually.

**Note**: If you believe you have met all requirements but have not received your certificate, check the following:
- Verify that every lesson shows as "completed" on the course page.
- Review your final assessment score against the passing threshold.
- Contact your instructor or submit a support ticket if the issue persists.
