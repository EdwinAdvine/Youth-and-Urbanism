## Creating a New Post

### How to Post

1. Click **New Post** at the top of the forum.
2. Fill in the following:
   - **Title**: A clear, descriptive title that summarizes your post (e.g., "How do I solve quadratic equations?" or "Tips for Grade 8 Science revision").
   - **Category**: Choose the most relevant category (see Categories section below).
   - **Content**: Write your post. You can:
     - Format text with bold, italics, headings, and lists.
     - Add links to resources.
     - Include images or screenshots.
     - Write code blocks (if sharing code or formulas).
   - **Tags**: Add relevant tags to help others find your post (e.g., "math", "grade-7", "science", "homework-help").
3. Click **Publish**.

### Tips for Writing Good Posts

- **Be specific**: "I need help understanding the difference between speed and velocity" is better than "Help with physics."
- **Provide context**: Mention your grade level, the course you are taking, or what you have already tried.
- **Use a clear title**: This helps others decide if they can help before clicking.
- **Format your post**: Use paragraphs, headings, and lists to make longer posts easy to read.

### How to Reply

1. Open the post you want to reply to.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the discussion.

### Writing Helpful Replies

- Answer the question directly before adding extra context.
- If you are sharing a solution, explain the steps so the person can learn, not just copy.
- Be encouraging -- everyone is here to learn.
- If you do not know the answer, you can still ask clarifying questions to help the person think through the problem.

If you asked a question and someone provided the right answer:

1. Find the reply that best answers your question.
