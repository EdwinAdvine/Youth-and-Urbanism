## Earning Money

### Revenue Sharing Model

Urban Home School uses a transparent revenue sharing model for paid courses:

| Recipient | Share |
|---|---|
| Instructor (You) | 60% |
| Platform (Urban Home School) | 30% |

For example, if your course is priced at KES 1,000 and a student enrolls:

- You earn KES 600.
- The platform receives KES 300.
- The referring partner (if any) receives KES 100.

If there is no referring partner, the split is 60% instructor and 40% platform.
