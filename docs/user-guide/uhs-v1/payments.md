## Paying with M-Pesa

M-Pesa is the most popular payment method on Urban Home School. Here is how it works:

### Step-by-Step

1. Select the course or plan you want to purchase.
2. Choose **M-Pesa** as your payment method.
3. Enter your **Safaricom phone number** (e.g., 0712345678 or 254712345678).
4. Click **Pay Now**.
5. You will receive an **STK push notification** on your phone from M-Pesa.
6. Enter your **M-Pesa PIN** on your phone to confirm the payment.
7. Wait a few seconds for the payment to be processed.
8. Once confirmed, you will see a success message on the platform.
9. A receipt is sent to your email and available in your payment history.

### Troubleshooting M-Pesa Payments

- **Did not receive the prompt?** Make sure you entered the correct phone number and try again. Check that your phone is on and has network coverage.
- **Payment timed out?** The STK push expires after about 60 seconds. Try the payment again.
- **Insufficient balance?** Check your M-Pesa balance by dialing *334# on your Safaricom line.
- **Wrong PIN?** You have a limited number of attempts before M-Pesa locks your account. If locked, contact Safaricom customer care.
- **Payment deducted but not reflected?** Wait a few minutes for the system to update. If the issue persists, go to **Settings > Help & Support > Report an Issue** and include your M-Pesa transaction ID.

2. You will see:

4. Complete the payment.
5. Your wallet balance updates immediately.

### Paying from Your Wallet

When purchasing a course or subscription:

1. At checkout, select **Wallet** as your payment method.
2. If you have enough balance, the amount is deducted instantly.
3. If your balance is insufficient, you will be prompted to top up or choose another payment method.

### Transaction History

- Top-ups (money added).
- Purchases (money spent on courses, subscriptions, etc.).
- Refunds (money returned to your wallet).
- Date, amount, and description for each transaction.

## For Instructors: Earnings and Payouts

### How You Earn

As an instructor, you earn money when students enroll in your paid courses. The revenue sharing model is:

| Recipient | Share |
|---|---|
| Instructor (You) | 60% |
| Platform (Urban Home School) | 30% |
| Partner (if applicable) | 10% |

If no partner referred the student, the split is 60% to you and 40% to the platform.

### Viewing Your Earnings

1. Go to **Earnings** in the sidebar.
2. You will see:
   - Total earnings (lifetime).
   - This month's earnings.
   - Earnings per course.
   - Pending payout amount.

### How Payouts Work

- Payouts are processed **monthly**.
- Earnings accumulated by the end of each month are paid out within the **first 10 days** of the following month.
- The **minimum payout threshold** is KES 500. If your balance is below this, it carries over to the next month.

### Setting Up Your Payout Method

1. Go to **Settings > Payout Details**.
2. Choose your method:
   - **M-Pesa**: Enter your Safaricom phone number.
   - **Bank Transfer**: Enter your bank name, branch, and account number.
3. Save your details.

### Payout History

Go to **Earnings > Payout History** to see all past payouts with dates, amounts, and status (completed, processing, or failed).

### If a Payout Fails

- Check that your payout details are correct in Settings.
- Common reasons for failure: incorrect phone number, inactive M-Pesa account, or bank details mismatch.
- Contact our support team at instructors@urbanhomeschool.co.ke if the issue persists.
