## What Is The Urban Bird AI?

The Urban Bird AI -- or simply "The Bird" -- is your child's personal AI tutor. Think of it as a patient, always-available teacher that:

- Answers questions in a way the student can understand.
- Explains difficult concepts step by step.
- Adapts its teaching to how the student learns best.
- Tracks what the student has mastered and what needs more practice.
- Supports text, voice, and video responses.

The Bird is powered by advanced AI models and is designed to complement -- not replace -- human teachers. It is available 24/7, so students can get help whenever they need it.
