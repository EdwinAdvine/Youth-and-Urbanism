## What Are Learning Paths?

A Learning Path is a personalized sequence of courses, topics, and practice activities generated by The Bird AI based on your academic profile, performance data, and learning goals. Instead of choosing what to study next on your own, your Learning Path guides you through a structured progression designed to help you master subjects efficiently.

Think of a Learning Path as a study plan created by a personal tutor who knows your strengths, weaknesses, and goals.

### Why Learning Paths Matter

- **No guesswork**: You always know what to study next.
- **Personalized pace**: The path adapts to how quickly or slowly you learn each topic.
- **Gap filling**: The AI identifies topics where you need improvement and prioritizes them.
- **Goal-oriented**: Paths are aligned with your grade level and curriculum objectives.
- **Motivation**: Seeing your progress along a clear path helps maintain motivation.

## How Learning Paths Are Generated

The Bird AI analyzes multiple data points to create your personalized Learning Path:

### Data Points Used

| Data Point | How It Is Used |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Grade Level** | Determines the CBC curriculum level and appropriate course difficulty |
| **Enrolled Courses** | Considers courses you are currently taking to avoid duplication |
| **Assessment Scores** | Identifies strong and weak areas across subjects |
| **Lesson Completion** | Tracks which topics you have covered and which remain |
| **AI Tutor Conversations** | Analyzes questions you ask to detect areas of confusion |
| **Time Spent** | Considers how long you spend on different topics (longer may indicate difficulty) |
| **Learning Patterns** | Notes when you study best and how you prefer to learn |

### Generation Process

1. The AI collects your performance data across all subjects.
2. It maps your current knowledge against the CBC curriculum requirements for your grade.
3. It identifies gaps, strengths, and upcoming milestones.
4. It generates a recommended sequence of activities ordered by priority and prerequisite logic.
5. The path is updated regularly (typically weekly) as you make progress.

---

## Path Components

A Learning Path consists of several types of activities:

### Recommended Courses

Courses that the AI suggests based on your current progress and gaps. Each recommendation includes:

- **Course title and description**
- **Why it is recommended**: A short explanation (e.g., "You scored 58% on fractions. This course covers fraction fundamentals.")
- **Estimated duration**
- **Priority level**: High, Medium, or Low

### Topic Focus Areas

Specific topics within your enrolled courses that need attention:

- **Topic name and subject**
- **Current mastery level**: Percentage indicating how well you understand the topic
- **Suggested activities**: Lessons to review, practice problems, or flashcards
- **Improvement target**: What mastery level you should aim for

### Practice Activities

AI-generated practice exercises tailored to your weak areas:

- **Practice quizzes**: Targeted questions on topics you are struggling with
- **Problem sets**: Math and science problems at your current level
- **Flashcards**: Vocabulary, formulas, or key concepts to memorize
- **Review sessions**: Summaries of previously covered material for reinforcement

### Milestones

Checkpoints along your path that mark significant progress:

- **Subject mastery**: "Master Grade 5 Fractions"
- **Course completion**: "Complete CBC Mathematics Grade 5"
- **Skill development**: "Achieve 80% accuracy in word problems"
- **Assessment readiness**: "Ready for mid-term exam"

Each milestone shows:

- What it represents
- How close you are to reaching it
- What activities remain before you reach it

## Adaptive Learning

Your Learning Path is not static. It adapts continuously based on your progress.

### How Adaptation Works

- **When you excel**: If you score highly on a topic, the AI marks it as mastered and moves you to the next topic sooner. It may also increase the difficulty of future recommendations.
- **When you struggle**: If you score below the target on a topic, the AI adds additional practice activities and may recommend prerequisite topics you may have missed.
- **When you skip**: If you skip recommended activities, the AI adjusts the path but may flag the skipped topics as still requiring attention.
- **When you explore**: If you take a course or topic not in your path, the AI incorporates that progress into your overall profile.

### Adaptation Frequency

- **Real-time**: Performance on quizzes and practice immediately influences recommendations.
- **Daily**: The AI reviews your activity and may adjust the sequence of upcoming activities.
- **Weekly**: A more comprehensive recalculation of your Learning Path based on the full week's data.

## CBC Alignment

All Learning Paths are aligned with Kenya's Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) framework.

### How CBC Alignment Works

- The AI maps all courses and topics to CBC learning areas, strands, sub-strands, and competencies.
- Your Learning Path ensures you cover all required CBC competencies for your grade level.
- Progress is tracked against CBC standards, so you can see how you measure up to national curriculum expectations.

### CBC Learning Areas Covered

- Mathematics
- English Language
- Kiswahili Language
- Science and Technology
- Social Studies
- Creative Arts
- Health Education
- Religious Education (optional)
- Physical and Sports Education (supplementary)

### Grade-Level Progression

The AI tracks your readiness for grade-level advancement:

- **On track**: You are meeting CBC competencies for your current grade.
- **Ahead**: You are exceeding expectations and may be ready for advanced content.
- **Needs support**: Some competencies are behind schedule and need focused attention.

## Sharing Your Learning Path with Parents

If you are a student under 18, your Learning Path is visible to your parent or guardian on their Parent Dashboard.

### What Parents See

- Your current Learning Path with all recommended activities
- Your progress along the path
- Areas where you are excelling and areas needing improvement
- AI recommendations for how parents can support your learning at home

### How Parents Access It

1. Parents log in to their Parent Dashboard.
2. Navigate to the specific child's profile.
3. Click on the **Learning Path** tab.
4. View the same path information, along with parent-specific recommendations.

---

## Instructor-Recommended Paths

In addition to AI-generated paths, instructors can create and assign Learning Paths for their students.

### How Instructor Paths Work

1. An instructor identifies that a group of students needs to follow a specific learning sequence.
2. The instructor creates a Learning Path with selected courses, topics, and activities.
3. The path is assigned to specific students or a class.
4. Students see the instructor-recommended path alongside their AI-generated path.

### Combining AI and Instructor Paths

When you have both an AI-generated path and an instructor-recommended path:

- Both appear in your Learning Path view.
- Instructor-recommended items are highlighted with a badge indicating they were assigned by a teacher.
- The AI path takes instructor assignments into account and will not duplicate them.
- You can prioritize either path based on your needs and deadlines.

## Tips for Following Your Learning Path

1. **Check your path daily**: Start each study session by looking at what your Learning Path recommends next. This saves time deciding what to study.

2. **Do not skip fundamentals**: If the AI recommends a prerequisite topic, trust the recommendation. Skipping fundamentals often leads to confusion in later, more advanced topics.

3. **Celebrate milestones**: When you reach a milestone, take a moment to acknowledge your progress. The platform may award badges for milestone completion.

4. **Trust the adaptation**: If the path changes after a quiz or assessment, it is because the AI is adjusting to help you learn more effectively. Embrace the changes rather than resisting them.

5. **Set weekly goals**: Use your Learning Path milestones as weekly goals. Aim to complete a certain number of recommended activities each week.

6. **Ask The Bird for help**: If an activity on your path feels too difficult, ask The Bird AI for help before skipping it. Often a short explanation is all you need to get unstuck.

7. **Review completed items**: Periodically revisit completed topics using the Practice or Flashcard quick actions to reinforce your knowledge.

8. **Share with your parent**: Keep your parent informed about your Learning Path progress. They can provide additional support for topics you find challenging.
