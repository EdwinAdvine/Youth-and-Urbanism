## What Is The Bird AI?

The Bird AI is a multi-AI orchestrated tutor designed specifically for Kenyan students. Unlike a single chatbot, The Bird uses a team of AI models working together to give you the best possible answers depending on what you are learning.

Behind the scenes, The Bird routes your questions to the most suitable AI provider:

| AI Model | Strengths | When It Is Used |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Gemini Pro** (Google) | Reasoning, step-by-step problem solving, general education | Default model for most questions |
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | Creative writing, detailed explanations, nuanced answers | Creative tasks, essay writing, complex explanations |
| **Grok** (X.AI) | Current events, research, factual questions | Research questions and current affairs |
| **GPT-4** (OpenAI) | Broad knowledge, versatile responses | Fallback when other models are unavailable |

You do not need to choose which model to use. The Bird automatically selects the best one based on your question.

## Asking Questions

### Text Input

1. Type your question in the message box at the bottom of the chat screen.
2. Press **Enter** or click the **Send** button.
3. The Bird will respond with an answer tailored to your grade level.

### Tips for Better Questions

- **Be specific**: "Explain how photosynthesis works in Grade 6 Science" is better than "What is photosynthesis?"
- **Mention your grade level**: This helps The Bird calibrate the difficulty of its response.
- **Provide context**: "I am studying fractions and I do not understand how to add fractions with different denominators" gives The Bird more to work with.
- **Ask follow-ups**: If the first answer is unclear, say "Can you explain that in simpler words?" or "Give me another example."
- **Request specific formats**: "Give me a step-by-step solution" or "Explain this with a diagram description."

### Subject-Specific Questions

The Bird can help with all CBC curriculum subjects:

- **Mathematics**: Problem solving, explanations, practice questions
- **Science**: Concepts, experiments, diagrams
- **English**: Reading comprehension, grammar, essay writing
- **Kiswahili**: Vocabulary, grammar, composition

## Response Modes

The Bird can respond in multiple formats to suit your learning style.

### Text Responses

### Voice Responses (ElevenLabs)

The Bird can read its responses aloud using natural-sounding AI voices powered by ElevenLabs.

### Video Responses (Synthesia)

For complex topics, The Bird can generate short AI video lessons using Synthesia. Video responses feature:

- An AI presenter explaining the concept visually
- On-screen text and diagrams
- Suitable for visual learners

**Note**: Video generation takes longer than text responses. Use video mode for topics that benefit from visual explanation.

## AI Model Routing

The Bird uses intelligent routing to send your question to the best AI model. Here is how routing works:

### General Questions (Gemini Pro)

- Standard curriculum questions
- Step-by-step math solutions
- Science explanations
- Most everyday learning questions

### Creative Tasks (Claude)

The Bird routes to Claude when it detects creative or language-heavy tasks:

- Essay writing and composition
- Creative writing and storytelling
- Detailed explanations requiring nuance
- Kiswahili language tasks

### Research Questions (Grok)

For questions about current events or topics requiring up-to-date information:

- "What happened in Kenya this week?"
- "What are the latest developments in renewable energy?"
- Current affairs and social studies research

### Fallback (GPT-4)

If the primary model for a task is unavailable, The Bird automatically falls back to GPT-4 to ensure you always get a response.

### How Routing Is Transparent

You may see a small indicator showing which AI model responded to your question. This is for information only and does not require any action from you.

## Tips for Effective Learning with The Bird

1. **Start with what you know**: Tell The Bird what you already understand about a topic so it can build on your knowledge.
2. **Ask for examples**: Concrete examples help cement abstract concepts.
3. **Use the Quiz action**: Regular self-testing is one of the most effective study techniques.
4. **Break down complex topics**: Ask The Bird to explain one part at a time rather than trying to understand everything at once.
5. **Practice regularly**: Short, daily sessions with The Bird are more effective than long, infrequent ones.
6. **Review your history**: Revisiting past explanations helps reinforce learning.
7. **Try different formats**: If text explanations are not clicking, try voice mode or ask for a different type of explanation.
8. **Be honest about what you do not understand**: The Bird works best when you tell it exactly where you are confused.
