# CoPilot

This guide covers the CoPilot sidebar assistant, a quick-access AI helper that provides contextual support while you work on lessons, assignments, and other activities within Urban Home School.

## What Is CoPilot?

CoPilot is a lightweight AI assistant that lives in a sidebar panel on the right side of your screen. Unlike the full Bird AI chat (which is a dedicated page), CoPilot is designed for quick interactions without leaving your current page.

Think of CoPilot as your study buddy sitting next to you -- always ready to help with a quick explanation, a hint on a problem, or a summary of your progress.

### CoPilot vs Full AI Tutor

| Feature | CoPilot (Sidebar) | Full Bird AI Chat |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Access** | Top bar button, opens as sidebar | Sidebar navigation, opens as full page |
| **Best for** | Quick questions, contextual help | Extended tutoring sessions |
| **Conversation length** | Short exchanges | Long, multi-turn conversations |
| **Tabs** | Chat, Performance, Settings | Chat only (with full history) |
| **Voice mode** | Limited | Full voice and video support |
| **Screen space** | Overlays on current page | Replaces current page |
| **History** | Current session | Full conversation history |
| **AI models** | Same multi-AI orchestration | Same multi-AI orchestration |

Both CoPilot and the full AI chat use the same underlying AI models and intelligence. The difference is in the interface and how you access it.

## Opening CoPilot

### From the Top Bar

1. Look for the **CoPilot** button in the top navigation bar. It appears as a small chat icon or the word "CoPilot."
2. Click the button to open the CoPilot sidebar panel on the right side of the screen.
3. Click the button again to close the panel.

### Keyboard Shortcut

You can quickly toggle CoPilot open and closed using a keyboard shortcut (if configured in your settings).

### On Different Pages

CoPilot is available on most pages within the platform, including:

- Dashboard
- Course lessons
- Quiz and assignment pages
- Forum
- Profile and settings

CoPilot is aware of which page you are on and can provide context-relevant assistance.

## CoPilot Tabs

The CoPilot sidebar has three main tabs: **Chat**, **Performance**, and **Settings**.

### Chat Tab

The Chat tab is where you interact with the AI assistant.

**How to use it:**

1. Type your question in the message input at the bottom of the CoPilot panel.
2. Press **Enter** or click **Send**.
3. The AI responds within the sidebar.
4. Continue the conversation as needed.

**What you can ask:**

- "What does 'denominator' mean?"
- "Give me a hint for this quiz question."
- "Summarize the lesson I just read."
- "What is the formula for the area of a triangle?"
- "Translate this sentence to Kiswahili."

**Contextual awareness:**

When you are on a specific lesson or course page, CoPilot may reference the current content. For example, if you are reading a lesson about photosynthesis and ask "Can you explain this further?", CoPilot understands that "this" refers to photosynthesis.

### Performance Tab

The Performance tab gives you a quick snapshot of your learning progress without leaving your current page.

**Metrics displayed:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Study Streak** | Number of consecutive days you have logged in and completed at least one learning activity. Displayed as a flame or calendar streak. |
| **Overall Progress** | Percentage of enrolled courses completed, shown as a progress ring or bar. |
| **Completion Rate** | Percentage of started courses that you have finished. |
| **Session Time** | Time spent learning in the current session and daily/weekly averages. |
| **Recent Activity** | A compact list of your most recent actions (lessons completed, quizzes taken, forum posts). |

**How it helps:**

- Quickly check if you are on track with your learning goals.
- See your streak at a glance to stay motivated.
- Review how much time you have spent studying today.

The Performance tab updates in real time as you complete activities.

### Settings Tab

The Settings tab lets you customize CoPilot and your AI agent's personality.

**Available settings:**

#### Agent Profile Settings

This is where you personalize the AI tutor that powers both CoPilot and the full Bird AI chat.

| Setting | Description | How to Configure |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Agent Name** | The name your AI tutor goes by. | Type a custom name (e.g., "Biri", "Prof", "Mwalimu"). |
| **Avatar** | The visual icon representing your AI tutor. | Choose from a gallery of available avatars. |
| **Personality** | The personality traits of your AI tutor. | Select traits like Friendly, Encouraging, Patient, Playful, or Serious. |
| **Response Style** | How detailed the AI's responses should be. | Choose Concise, Balanced, or Detailed. |
| **Expertise Focus** | Subjects or topics the AI should prioritize. | Select one or more subjects (Mathematics, Science, English, etc.). |
| **Quick Shortcuts** | Custom quick action buttons. | Define your own shortcuts for frequently used prompts. |

#### CoPilot Display Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-open** | Whether CoPilot opens automatically when you visit certain pages. |
| **Position** | Sidebar position (right side of screen). |
| **Notifications** | Whether CoPilot shows proactive suggestions (e.g., "You have been on this page for 10 minutes. Need help?"). |

Changes made in the Settings tab apply to both CoPilot and the full Bird AI chat, since they share the same AI agent profile.

## Chat Features

### Quick Questions

CoPilot excels at quick, focused questions:

- Definitions: "What is osmosis?"
- Formulas: "What is the Pythagorean theorem?"
- Translations: "How do you say 'good morning' in Kiswahili?"
- Quick math: "What is 15% of 240?"

### Contextual Help

When you are working on a lesson, quiz, or assignment, CoPilot can provide help related to your current activity:

- "Explain what this lesson is about."
- "I do not understand this question."
- "Give me a hint without telling me the answer."
- "What should I study before attempting this quiz?"

### Suggested Prompts

CoPilot may display suggested prompts based on your current context. For example:

- On a lesson page: "Summarize this lesson", "Quiz me on this topic"
- On a quiz page: "Explain question 3", "Give me a hint"
- On the dashboard: "What should I study today?", "How am I doing this week?"

Click any suggested prompt to send it as a message.

## Using CoPilot Effectively

### Best Practices

1. **Keep questions focused**: CoPilot works best with specific, concise questions. Save long, exploratory conversations for the full Bird AI chat.

2. **Use it during study sessions**: Open CoPilot while reading lessons to get instant clarifications without losing your place.

3. **Check your performance regularly**: Glance at the Performance tab daily to maintain awareness of your streak and progress.

4. **Customize your agent**: Take a few minutes to set up your agent profile. A personalized AI tutor makes the experience more engaging.

5. **Use quick shortcuts**: If you frequently ask the same types of questions, set up custom shortcuts in the Settings tab to save time.

### When to Use CoPilot vs Full Chat

**Use CoPilot when you:**
- Need a quick definition or formula
- Want a hint on a quiz question
- Want to check your progress
- Are in the middle of a lesson and need a quick clarification

**Use the full Bird AI chat when you:**
- Want an extended tutoring session
- Need detailed, multi-step explanations
- Want to use voice mode or video responses
- Want to access your full conversation history
- Are studying a new topic from scratch

## CoPilot State Management

CoPilot maintains its state throughout your session:

- **Chat messages** persist while the sidebar is open but reset when you close it or navigate to a new session.
- **Performance data** updates in real time.
- **Settings** are saved permanently and persist across sessions.
- **Agent profile** is shared between CoPilot and the full Bird AI chat.

The CoPilot state is managed by the `useCoPilotStore` (Zustand store), which handles:

- Panel open/closed state
- Active tab selection
- Chat message history for the current session
- Performance metrics
- Agent profile settings

## Troubleshooting

**CoPilot is not opening:**
- Ensure you are logged in with a student account.
